# Determinants of House Prices

### Analysing house prices in R using the popular Boston Housing Dataset. 

The aim of this project was to analyse the provided housing dataset using machine learning techniques to deride insights and patterns within the housing market. The report analyses the dataset through regression, clustering and classification techniques to achieve these aims. Notably, the reports regression model was able to account for 79% of sale price variance (adjusted R-squared of 0.79) and using K-means and Hierarchical clustering, were able to successfully group houses based on their features.

Below are some interesting visualisations taken from the project. To see the full project and analysis [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/Ryan-Daley/House-Price-Determinants) (link to github repository). Included in this repository is the original dataset, the R code sript and the final report pdf.
